Options:
4/5 argv for simple tests
[argv1]		The standard program (need .exe when inputting)
[argv2]		The wrong program
[argv3.1]	The data maker program
[argv3.2]	The data folder with data file names. For example, .\TestData\data (no suffix input(include numbers and .in) but the suffixes of data must be .in)
[argv4]		Number of datas
(argv5)		Time Limit
Especially note for argv3.2. The data file name may be ".\TestData\data1.in" and ".\TestData\data2.in"
But you only need to input ".\Test Data\data" and this program will do with the rest things automatically
Note that the suffix numbers of the data files MUST be consecutive from 1
'-' options:
-?/-help	Get more information about hep.exe. You can add -- as a suffix to choose the language of the help document. The languages we've finished translating are:
 --en-us	English
 --zn-ch	中文
-clear		Delete every file in folder "UnacceptedData". This argv MUST be the last one if there is more than one argv

[] are the argvs which must have values
() are the argvs which you can choose to place
x.y are the argvs which have y multi way to input and the same .y means the same argv set even the y are different
