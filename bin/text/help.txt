Options:
4/5 argv for simple tests
[argv1]		The standard program (need .exe)
[argv2]		The wrong program
[argv3.1]	The data maker program
[argv3.2]	The data folder with data file names. For example, .\\TestData\\data (no suffix input but the suffixes of data must be .in)
[argv4]		Number of datas
(argv5)		Time Limit
Especially note for argv3.2. The data file name may be \".\\TestData\\data1.in\" and \".\\TestData\\data2.in\"
But you only need to input \".\\Test Data\\data\" and this program will do with the rest things
Note that the suffix numbers of the data files MUST be consecutive from 1\n
\'-\' options:
-?/-help	Get more information about hep.exe
-clear		Delete every file in folder \"UnacceptedData\". This argv MUST be the last one

[] are the argues which must have values
() are the argues which you can choose to place
.x are the argues which have x multi way to input and the same .x means the same argue set
